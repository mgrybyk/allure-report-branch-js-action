## Troubleshooting

### Issues on push to gh-pages

Log `! [rejected]        HEAD -> gh-pages (non-fast-forward)`

Do not run your workflow concurrently per PR or branch!
```yaml
# Allow only one job per PR or branch
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.head_ref || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true # true to cancel jobs in progress, set to false otherwise
```

### Running in Windows or MacOS

The `allure-report-branch-js-action` is designed as a JavaScript action wrapped with `docker` action because `allure` requires java and is shipped with bunch of java files.

As far as `docker` action runs in linux environments only, it's required to do some extra steps for users running Windows and MacOS workflows. See [Types of actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#types-of-actions) for more details.

- option 1: using upload/download artifacts. See [simple-elf/allure-report-action/issues/28#issuecomment-1139332329](https://github.com/simple-elf/allure-report-action/issues/28#issuecomment-1139332329)
- option 2: use JS version of this action (raise an issue and I'll publish it). In this case you'll have to install Java and download download allure-commandline yourself.
